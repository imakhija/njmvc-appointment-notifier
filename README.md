# New Jersey MVC Appointment Notifier
Need an appointment to upgrade your license to a REAL ID but don't want to keep refreshing the NJMVC website all day?

Use this Python script to automatically notify you when a new appointment slot opens up!

Can run script in background or set up a local cron job to run every 60-300 seconds / use serverless infrastructure like Lambda for 24/7 uptime
